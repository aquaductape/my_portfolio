        Uploading images are done via Drag and Drop, pasting URL or webcam. The
        URL Text Input gives visual feedback if the inputs are valid images and
        also allows you to paste multiple URLs and easily update them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Successfull upload displays an image with tagged faces accompanied by a
        Table containing persons’ data. The Table Headers, which contain the
        data category, are fixed wherever the user scrolls, that way the user
        understands what the data cell relates to what category, without the
        need to scroll up. That functionality is not only preserved in Mobile
        layout, but is also done in a performant manner that doesn’t slow down
        the page when scrolling.

      <Heading2>Design</Heading2>
      <p>
        The theme is sharp corners and angles, everything is encapsulated in
        rectangles or squares, even the icons don’t have rounded edges.
      </p>
      <ImgContainer
        src={themeImg}
        alt={"screenshot of facify website"}
      ></ImgContainer>
      <p>
        This design choice did pose some challenges. One such example was
        recognizing buttons. Usually users are used to seeing buttons that have
        rounded edges. Due to the theme, the buttons would be rectangular
        without any rounded edges. This is no problem, sharp rectangle buttons
        do exist on the web and are usable. However in certain areas in the UI,
        such as nested boxes, I had trouble identifying which was an interactive
        button or a graphic.
      </p>
      <ImgContainer
        src={buttonsComparisonImg}
        alt={"comparison of bad button vs clarity button"}
      ></ImgContainer>
      <p>
        The simple solution was adding extra padding on the width, and it is
        more easily identifiable as a button.
      </p>
      <p>
        When uploading images you need to notify the user when the image
        results. Because the main area is reserved for existing image results, I
        placed the loader in the same area as the inputs.
      </p>
      <Video src={uploadVid}></Video>
      <p>
        The result not only displays a success message, but offers a jumping
        functionality, when tapping on the name you jump to the location of the
        result image. Similar to that when a notification on your smartphone
        pops up, if you select it, it opens the app which it was delivered by.
      </p>
      <p>
        I avoided alert push type notification because it will clutter the
        screen especially on mobile view. Even if the alert has a close button
        you would have to manually click every single one.
      </p>
      <Video src={notificationsComparisonsVid}></Video>
      <p>
        The solution was showing the results in the loading area, one at a time.
        The success result lasts about 5 seconds and then passes to the next
        queuing image. This might be annoying if you uploaded 5 images, and they
        successfully finished immediately, you would have to wait 25 seconds for
        the loader to go away. There’s a setting to turn off the countdown
        notification and the result only sticks around for a second instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        When scrolling through data or detailed information in mobile, it can be
        annoying because the necessary information will be already scrolled past
        due to limited screen size. I made sure set 3 components can show
        important information or utility were always in were.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Upload form</li>
        <li>Image Result</li>
        <li>Table Header</li>
      </ol>
      <ImgContainer
        src={alwaysInViewImg}
        alt={
          "three UI components always in view when scrolling, the Upload form, Image Result, and Table Header"
        }
      ></ImgContainer>
      <p>
        This eliminates the need to scroll up in order to upload more photos,
        it’s not abstracted away in a generic menu, it’s there in front of you.
        When scrolling through the Table data, the header is always in view,
        even in mobile view! Many sites that are centric around Tables tend to
        be unusable in mobile view because the header is not sticky so the user
        ends up forgetting what the values in the cells relate to. I go more in
        depth related to that topic in

      <p>
        I choose React for two reasons. One because it’s fun, I love working
        with JavaScript and React is a framework that completely embraces
        control with everything with JavaScript. Where other frameworks such as
        Angular or Svelte have separation of concerns, with React you get to
        write the content, state and logic all in one file thanks to the awesome
        JSX syntax. Second reason is the large ecosystem and community it has,
        so I have plenty of resources to utilize any time I’m stuck.
      </p>
      <p>
        React does have some pitfalls, you have to be careful not to cause
        unnecessary rerenders. The solution is that you have to make sure the
        state lives as close to it’s relevant descendants as possible.
      </p>
      <ImgContainer src={renderTreeImg} alt={"render tree"}></ImgContainer>
      <p>
        I use Redux for state management. React can get unproductive quickly if
        the app is using root level state, because you end up writing children
        properties everywhere, or what’s known in the React community,
        <HyperLink
          text={" prop drilling"}
          href={"https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling"}
        ></HyperLink>
        . React has it’s solution to grab global state properties without
        manually writing props and it’s ‘useContext’. However Context is not
        meant to be a global root level state, since even if one property in
        it’s large state updates, all of its descendants rerenders. That’s why
        Redux is popular in React apps, because it can make state management
        productive while keeping decent performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Redux is famous for its large boilerplate setup, writing files of
        reducers, actions, and dispatches, even for a simple counter app. Well
        not anymore, the team released an opinionated, lighter, batteries
        included alternative, Redux Toolkit. Redux Toolkit makes it easier for
        my mental model to think of state as slices. Writing the actions and
        dispatches is really fun and productive compared to classic Redux where
        you had to write more imperative code.
      </p>
      <p>
        For CSS, I used ‘styled-jsx’. This library lets you write style
        declarations within your components, inject Javascript and it also
        scopes styles the component, which prevents css clashes due to its
        global cascading nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        This boosted productivity tremendously, which global style sheets I
        would have to manage the namespacing myself. Unlike CSS modules or
        CSS-in-JS(ie styled-components), I can just write classes as is, without
        resorting to abstractions. I am aware that CSS modules is the better CSS
        modular choice for performance, but I choose to be productive for
        writing styles and allow easier maintenance, since everything is in one
        file.
      </p>
      <Heading3>Backend</Heading3>
      <p>
        Since I’m using the NextJS framework, it was easy to create API
        endpoints for backend functionality, and since the backend runs on
        NodeJS, I can quickly write logic without needing to switch to a
        different programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where I placed the functionality to parse images and perform
        Exif orientation.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Since one of the inputs is image URL string, it needs to be converted to
        base64 and compressed if needed. Converting to base64 could be done
        client side by using canvas or fetch, but that depends on whether the
        image follows
        <HyperLink
          text={" CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing Policy) "}
          href={"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS"}
        ></HyperLink>
        guidelines. In a gist, CORS is a specific security framework baked into
        the networking layer of the browser. Since the browser executes code
        dynamically from websites, it needs this layer of protection.
      </p>
      <ImgContainer src={corsSuccess} alt="CORS success"></ImgContainer>
      <p>
        In this example a user uses an image from a popular site Imgur, the
        image response that is sent from Imgur’s servers has important
        information attached to it, such as ‘access-control-allow-origin’. It’s
        access origin value is a wildcard ‘*’, and it means any site can access
        it. Facify site allowed by the CORS ruleset, can convert the image to
        base64. The same cannot be said if the image had a restrictive origin or
        no origin value present.
      </p>
      <ImgContainer src={corsError} alt="CORS error"></ImgContainer>
      <p>
        In this example a user grabs an image from a site Pinterest. That image
        doesn’t have ‘access-control-allow-origin’ present. So when there’s an
        attempt to get base64 from the image on the client side, CORS kicks in
        and prevents the site from converting the image to base64.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution was moving logic of the image conversion from client to the
        server. Unlike browsers, which are tightly controlled sandboxes, servers
        don’t have to follow CORS policies.
      </p>
      <ImgContainer
        src={corsServerSuccess}
        alt="CORS server success"
      ></ImgContainer>
      <p>
        The client communicates to the Facify server to fetch the image from
        pinterest and convert it to base64. Then the base64 data is sent to the
        client.
      </p>
      <Heading3>API Services</Heading3>
      <p>
        Face detection as well as demographic estimation, was made possible by
        using a service called Clarifai. Clarifai is a service that uses object
        detection in images, by using machine learning AI. Face detection is one
        of the many models that Clarifai provides, and in order to use it, they
        provide a NodeJS package for the backend.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Clarifai accepts certain kinds of images and has a size limit of
        3.4 megabytes, I made sure that on the frontend, image types are
        validated and images are compressed if they over the size limit.
      </p>
      <Heading2>Highlights</Heading2>
      <Heading3>URL Text Input</Heading3>
      <p>
        Rather than having a simple text input, I wanted to have an editor-like
        experience. When you type an Image URL and then press ‘Spacebar’ key
        after each URL, it will be added as an item in a list, where it contains
        the image of the URL and the name of the image. URL items can be
        removed, which will come in handy because a valid URL doesn’t guarantee
        an existing image.
      </p>
      <Video src={textInputRemoveVid}></Video>
      <p>
        Dealing with image URLs can get gnarly because the text can look cryptic
        and long, which is why the text result is shortened to the image name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course no one types image URLs by hand, the easier alternatives are
        copy/paste and Drag and Drop (yes, you can Drag and Drop text between
        apps), both which are supported in this app.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s no need to paste one URL at a time, if the copied text contains
        multiple URLs, they will be added as separate URLs.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, the user doesn’t have to worry about copying only URLs, the
        user can paste unknown text and the Text Input will filter out non-URLs.
      </p>
      <Heading3>Scroll Shadows</Heading3>
      <p>
        It’s helpful to give feedback to the user if the content is in a
        scrollable container. Most obvious one is displaying scrollbars. But in
        Mobile, it’s common not to present scrollbars because they take up too
        much space. The common pattern is to show a Shadow to help the user
        understand that the content is inside a scrollable container.
      </p>
      <Video src={scrollShadowVid}></Video>
      <p>
        This used to be easy to implement in CSS, by using the{" "}
        <HyperLink
          text={" background-attachment property "}
          href={"https://lea.verou.me/2012/04/background-attachment-local/"}
        ></HyperLink>
      </p>
      <p>
        However this CSS trick no longer works in Safari, the solution had to be
        done through JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        The easiest way to solve it, is by checking scroll position and check if
        it’s at the beginning or end, by using the scroll event. The issue with
        this solution is that calculating the scroll container’s size can be
        expensive and that procedure is fired continuously throughout the scroll
        duration. Worst case scenario result is that scrolling through content
        will be noticeably slow or janky to the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        The optimal solution is using{" "}
        <HyperLink
          text={" Intersection Observer API"}
          href={
            "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API"
          }
        ></HyperLink>
        . I placed two “sentries” elements at the top of the scroll container
        and one at the bottom. If a “sentry” is in view, it will trigger the
        shadow element to hide, but if not the shadow will appear. This is much
        more performant than relying on a scroll event.
      </p>
      <Heading3>Fixed Table Header</Heading3>
      <p>There are two different ways to create a sticky Header.</p>
      <p>
        One way is using JavaScript by setting the header’s position while you
        scroll. That method is okay as long as updating the position is done by
        using CSS transform property, so that the browser doesn’t recalculate
        expensive Layout changes every frame you scroll. However if there’s too
        many JavaScript tasks running, the header’s position will be delayed
        resulting in poor user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second is using the CSS property “position: sticky” which is placed
        relative to its parent container and remains in view. This is the best
        solution because CSS based solutions are more performant because it
        won’t be interrupted by JavaScript. For the rest of this section the
        “fixed” behavior will be referred to as “sticky”.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I used the CSS sticky solution
        <HyperLink
          text={" based from this helpful article"}
          href={"https://adrianroselli.com/2020/01/fixed-table-headers.html"}
        ></HyperLink>
        . Unfortunately I ran into problems. When wrapped in scroll container,
        sticky will be relative to its scroll container and won’t respond.
      </p>
      <p>
        This video example shows that the sticky table Header doesn’t respond to
        the scroll of the body element (the outermost container).
      </p>
      <Video src={badFixedHeaderVid}></Video>
      <p>
        The solution was using “sentry” elements that utilize the Intersection
        Observer API, that way to image data Header sticky behavior is emulated
        when scrolling in the outermost container such as the “body” element.
